Welcome to my site! I'm Felix Chu.

I love coding and games. They have a lot in commmon. When you finally beat the big bad boss
 after hours of struggling and dying over and over-- it's the same feeling as finally
 fixing that bug you've been hunting for days, isn't it? Both offer a never-ending challenge; 
there's always room to improve your skills, and there's always someone better than you. Lastly,
and maybe most importantly, they're both fun, in their own little ways.

This site is WIP.

Come back later to check out blog posts my coding projects!
