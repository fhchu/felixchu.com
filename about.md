After realizing as a 10-year-old on Roblox that game devs need to know how to code, I pragmatically grew up to be a software engineer instead. I've since decided that building games is my [ikigai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ikigai).

Inspired by games like Legends of Runeterra and Super Smash Bros Ultimate, I am currently working on RPS Advanced (working title), a deceptively simple 1v1 strategy game you can play with your friends or your mom!

My interests include mental health and political advocacy (Trans rights!). I also enjoy movies (Interstellar, Good Will Hunting), music (Snail's House, New Jeans), and anime (Jojo's Bizarre Adventure, Death Parade).
