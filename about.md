After realizing at age of 10 as a Roblox gamer that game devs need to know how to code, I pragmatically grew up to be a software engineer before deciding that building games is my ikigai.

Inspired by games like Legends of Runeterra and Super Smash Bros Ultimate, I am currently working on RPS Advanced (working title), a deceptively simple 1v1 strategy game you can play with your friends or your mom!

My interests include mental health and political advocacy (Trans rights!). I also enjoy movies (Interstellar, Good Will Hunting), music (Snail's House, New Jeans), and anime (Jojo's Bizarre Adventure, Death Parade).
